# Introduction 
## Motivation 
The use of online services is part of our daily lives. An example of an online services is ,Google, and there is a need for an account touse these services.
A digital identinty can be represented as an account.

Companies that own these online services hold identity related data for millions of users in digital silos. These silos attract attackers with the incentive
of having accessto huge amounts of data.

Managers of digital identies need to ensure data security and privacy. Users also have to trust the managers since they have no control over their data
and even if they are not fully conviced about the security and privacy of the identity managing party.

SSI(Self Soverign Identity) addresses the central trusted party of traditional IdM(Identity Management) systems by using DL(Distributed Ledger) Technology.
However in SSI, identity are often self-asserted with being trusted poorly. Additionally, users are able to make claims about themselves and other parties can attest
these claims or even attest claims that are not self-asserted.
